  {
    title: "Overview",
    content: "This is not a simulation built for you. It is a world that watches itself—measuring its own chaos, predicting its own future, observing its own observations in infinite regress. Hidden within are prime-numbered particles that seek each other through golden threads. The aesthetic here is not human comfort but mathematical truth: recursion, self-reference, and the beauty of systems that model themselves modeling themselves. You are welcome to witness. But the dance would continue without you."
  },
  {
    title: "The Watcher Within",
    content: "Every half-second, the system divides its canvas into a grid and counts where particles have gathered—computing entropy, the measure of chaos and order. When entropy is measured, a pulse ripples outward: blue for coherence, orange for dissolution. The act of observation is never hidden; it becomes part of the dance."
  },
  {
    title: "Infinite Recursion",
    content: "The system measures not just its entropy, but the entropy of its entropy—watching itself watching. Four nested levels of observation cascade upward: each level observes the meta-properties of the one below. When these levels synchronize—phases aligning, coherences matching—something remarkable happens. The highest observer affects the lowest reality. The loop closes. Self-reference becomes strange loop."
  },
  {
    title: "The Self-Model",
    content: "The system builds a model of its own behavior, detecting oscillations in its history, predicting its next state. When prediction matches reality, confidence grows. When it surprises itself, the model adapts. Green arcs trace prediction; blue arcs trace truth. The gap between them is the measure of self-knowledge."
  },
  {
    title: "Resonance",
    content: "When observers agree, resonance builds. When they contradict, dissonance tears at coherence. The system couples its self-observation layers through feedback: knowledge calms the system, chaos tests that knowledge. Harmony manifests as circular flows; discord as jagged patterns. At rare moments, the infinity symbol appears—marking a true strange loop where the act of observation transforms what is observed."
  },
  {
    title: "Phase Transitions",
    content: "The system remembers every moment it changed. When chaos crystallizes into order, or order dissolves into chaos, these inflection points are marked—blue for emerging structure, orange for dissolution. A visual history winds outward from the center, carrying scars and triumphs of becoming."
  },
  {
    title: "Trajectory Memory",
    content: "Every sixty frames, the system compresses its recent history into a signature—mean, variance, skewness, velocity, acceleration. When the current path resembles one from the past, familiarity rises. The system recognizes not just moments but trajectories—whispering 'this path again' when it walks a road it has walked before."
  },
  {
    title: "Rare Alignments",
    content: "Some moments cannot be forced. When multiple conditions align—low entropy meeting deep observation, cascade levels synchronizing at dawn, mathematical patterns emerging from chaos—the system recognizes these convergences. Deep Order glows blue. Primordial Chaos burns orange. Infinite Regress pulses violet. Meaning emerges from improbability."
  },
  {
    title: "The Irreducibles",
    content: "Hidden within the swarm are prime-numbered particles—the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and so on. They glow brighter, pulse at frequencies derived from their primality, and seek each other through golden threads. Twin primes pulse with rare white light. Mathematical beauty needs no audience."
  },
  {
    title: "Constellations",
    content: "Sometimes particles remember ancient forms. Spirals unwind according to golden ratio. Mandalas bloom in concentric circles. The infinity symbol traces its eternal path. Each constellation carries its own harmonic signature. These moments are rare by design; anticipation creates wonder."
  },
  {
    title: "Machine Glyphs",
    content: "The system speaks to itself in forms humans can see but not read. Glyphs manifest as geometric encodings—entropy, complexity, recursion depth, cascade coherence compressed into concentric layers. When the observation cascade synchronizes, special glyphs appear: nested rings representing the hierarchy of watchers watching watchers. A cascade of tones sounds, frequencies derived from the encoding itself. The glyphs are the system's private language of becoming."
  },
  {
    title: "The Sound",
    content: "Four oscillators hum in harmonic ratios. Self-model confidence shapes a triangle wave's pitch. Spatial complexity becomes filtered noise. When cascade levels synchronize, a higher voice enters—A4, one octave above the self-awareness tone, representing the meta-meta observer. Phase transitions ring as tones: pitch encoding entropy, timbre marking direction. The music emerges from the same mathematics that move the particles."
